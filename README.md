The file you shared is a comprehensive Python script implementing sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes the following agenda items:

Loading and preprocessing the IMDB dataset (padding sequences to a fixed length).

Building a neural network model with an embedding layer, global average pooling, and dense layers for binary classification.

Training the model with training data and evaluating its accuracy on test data.

A prediction function for single reviews.

Visualizations:

Distribution of review lengths.

Class balance of positive and negative reviews.

Word clouds for frequent words in positive and negative reviews (Частые слова для положительных/отрицательных отзывов﻿).

Plots of training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs (Точность модели﻿, Потери модели﻿).

Confusion matrix visualization of model predictions versus actual labels.

Regarding the file name, it could be called something like:

imdb_sentiment_analysis.py

sentiment_analysis_imdb.py

or any name indicating it is an IMDB sentiment classification with visualization.

This script is a typical example of an end-to-end sentiment analysis workflow combining deep learning and data visualization for insight into the model and dataset.
